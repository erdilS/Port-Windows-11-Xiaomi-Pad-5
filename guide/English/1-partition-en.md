This step is required so that we make partitions where our Windows installation will be

## Notes:
> **Warning** if you delete any partitions via diskpart later on or now windows will send a ufs command that gets misinterpreted which erase all your ufs
- All your data will be erased! Backup now if needed.
- These commands have been tested.
- Ignore `udevadm` warnings
- Do not run the same command twice
- On recovery, screen not working.
- DO NOT REBOOT YOUR PHONE if you think you made a mistake, ask for help in the [Telegram chat](https://t.me/nabuwoa)

#### Boot recovery through the PC with the command
```cmd
fastboot boot <recovery.img>
```
> If you already have TWRP installed, just hold the power and vol+ buttons at startup

#### Unmount all partitions
```cmd
adb shell twrp unmount /data
```

## Push parted to /tmp/
> For reparting the partitions
```cmd
adb push parted /tmp/
```

## Start the ADB shell
```cmd
adb shell
```

### Resize the partition table
> So that the Windows partitions would fit
```sh
sgdisk --resize-table 64 /dev/block/sda
```

### Fixing parted permissions
```sh
chmod 755 /tmp/parted
```

### Start parted
```sh
/tmp/parted /dev/block/sda
```


### Delete the `userdata` partition
> You can make sure that 31 is the userdata partition number by running
>  `print all`
```sh
rm 31
```

### Create partitions
> If you get any warning message telling you to ignore or cancel, just type i and enter

#### For 128Gb models:

- Create the ESP partition (stores Windows bootloader data and EFI files)
```sh
mkpart esp fat32 10.9GB 11.4GB
```

- Create the main partition where Windows will be installed to
```sh
mkpart win ntfs 11.4GB 70.2GB
```

- Create Android's data partition
```sh
mkpart userdata ext4 70.2GB 126GB
```

#### For 256Gb models:

- Create the ESP partition (stores Windows bootloader data and EFI files)
```sh
mkpart esp fat32 10.9GB 11.4GB
```

- Create the main partition where Windows will be installed to
```sh
mkpart win ntfs 11.4GB 120.8GB
```

- Create Android's data partition
```sh
mkpart userdata ext4 120.8GB 254GB
```


### Make ESP partiton bootable so the EFI image can detect it
```sh
set 31 esp on
```

### Quit parted
```sh
quit
```
### Reboot to bootloader
```sh
reboot bootloader
```

### Boot to recovery
```cmd
fastboot boot <recovery.img>
```

### Start the shell again on your PC
```cmd
adb shell
```

### Format partitions
-  Format the ESP partiton as FAT32
```sh
mkfs.fat -F32 -s1 /dev/block/bootdevice/by-name/esp -n ESPNABU
```

-  Format the Windows partition as NTFS
```sh
mkfs.ntfs -f /dev/block/bootdevice/by-name/win -L WINNABU
```

-  Format the userdata
```sh
mke2fs -t ext4 /dev/block/bootdevice/by-name/userdata
```

### Check if Android still starts
just restart the phone, and see if Android still works
If isn't boot or looping or animation, use MIUI recovery or other recoveries for wiping data.
