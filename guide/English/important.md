# Running Windows on the Xiaomi Pad 5

## Important notes/warnings
> While the Xiaomi Pad 5 is currently one of the most supported and stable Android devices to run Windows on, there are some rare issues that may severely affect your device. Make sure you understand these issues before installing Windows.

## 24H2 EDL issues
If you installed Windows on your NABU before 07.12.2024 and have not applied the GPT fix, please do so now using [this guide](fix-gpt-en.md) to avoid EDl issues.

## White line issues
In some extremely rare cases, your screen may display white lines after putting it to sleep in Windows. This is a hardware issue caused by Xiaomi shipping out screens with incompatible display configurations.

If you see white lines after sleeping in Windows, **REBOOT IMMEDIATELY!!**. These lines can become permanent if they stay on the screen for too long.

Currently the only solution is to either never put your device to sleep in Windows, or to sell your nabu and buy a new one.
